The app is designed with a unique and cohesive color scheme that enhances its visual appeal and ease of use. The color palette includes shades of grey, white,
and yellow, with the upload button and person icon having matching grey colors. The upload button has a larger size, rounded corners, and yellow text color,
 while the submit button has a compact and elevated design with a solid yellow background color and white text color.
 Customization of the app's design and functionality is easily possible by modifying the widget properties and styles.


I add upload button which has a grey background color,
rounded corners, and yellow text color with a larger size and padding on the left and right.
 The submit button has a default elevated button style with a solid yellow background color and white text color, a smaller size with padding only on the sides.
 These styles differentiate the buttons and help convey their respective functions to the user.
